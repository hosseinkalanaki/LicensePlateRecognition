## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment**: Run the following command to create a new virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
   Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name.

2. **Install required packages**: Activate your virtual environment and run the following command to install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This will download and install all the necessary packages for the project.

3. **Run a session**: Once the packages are installed, you can execute any session file (e.g., `session.py`) using Python:
   ```
   python session.py
   ```
   Replace `session.py` with the name of the session file you want to run.

## Notes

* Make sure to activate your virtual environment before installing packages or running sessions.
* If you encounter any issues, check the `requirements.txt` file for package dependencies and ensure that your environment is properly configured.
